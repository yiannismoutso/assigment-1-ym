    <h1>Personal Information</h1>
    <p>Hello, my name is Ioannis Moutsopoulos, but people tend to call me Yiannis as it is easier to say. My student number and email are s3944808@student.rmit.edu.au and I am enrolled in Bachelor of Information Technology. I am 18 years old, and I moved here in Australia in 2016. I was born and raised in Greece. My mum was born in Australia, so we made this choice to move countries. I speak Greek fluently and my favourite food is obviously souvlaki…  I play domestic and representative basketball. I love listening to music and hanging out with my friends in my spare time. I have a puppy named Rosie. She is a Maltese- shitzu.</p>

    <h1>Interest in IT</h1>
<p>My interest in IT started in Greece in my digital technology class. I believe I was in year 5 when I first started learning about computers. We obviously started learning about the basics but as time went on, my love for IT was increasing. Then, when I came to Australia, in year 9 I selected digital technology as one of my electives. We started coding in python and making little games like flappy bird. That’s when I decided that I wanted a career with IT in my future as I was interested in it a lot.

<p>I chose to come to RMIT as I heard many of my peers saying that RMIT was the best uni in Melbourne if you want to study technology. Some of my friends also attend RMIT and it’s a good experience catching the train with them and hanging out in the city after classes.</p>

<p>In my studies, I expect to learn how to code properly and learn more about the software of a computer. As I said above, I want to follow a career in IT and specifically Cyber Security. I trust that RMIT can help me achieve my goals of being successful.</p>

<p>A position that interests me is a cyber security analyst, particularly within the company Interactive.

<p>To pursue this role some of the requirements are to have obtained 2 years’ experience working within a cyber security role prior to applying, are available to work night shifts, have a strong will to learn new cyber security tools and get involved and partake in new projects. As well as understanding infrastructure level tech, of offensive security tools, and of adversarial and malware behaviour.</p>

<h1>Personal Profile</h1>
<p>On the 16 personalities test I achieved a consul personality. In summary a consul personality is a person with an extroverted, observant, feeling and sometimes judging trait. In most cases they are attentive, and people focused, I find that these do reflect some of my own personality traits as I do tend to gravitate to be the more social person in most settings and I tend to find myself watching what goes on around me. In terms of my results in the learning style test, it shows that I am an auditory learner. Therefore, meaning that I learn by hearing and listening, and understand and remember things when I have been told them. This again is my preferred style of learning, so the result of the test is accurate in terms of my situation. In the big 5 personality test my highest score was under agreeableness, which is the tendency to put others needs ahead of my own, and to rather cooperate than compete. In most cases I find myself opting to work with others than to go head on and disagree completely, I usually am quite easy with other people’s opinions and try to work in others favours.</p>
<p>Considering all these tests which I find reflect my traits quite accurately, I think they are both suitable and can be disadvantageous in team settings. Being extroverted and more social would be beneficial as that is needed in teamwork in order to communicate, as well as my auditory learning style, communication is key in teams so having that would prove helpful. Although being open to putting others before myself and my own work can be good, it can also prove to be more detrimental in some cases. This can influence my behaviour in a team to sometimes not put my own opinions forward and offer changes to avoid any disagreements. I believe this is something that I should work on in order to ensure I am being most efficient in group settings and in general for my own benefit.</p>
<p>When forming a team these traits show that I can work well in a team if I put myself forward but also hear others out and make sure to understand what is going on. In a team I should ensure to communicate as that is key to make certain everything works and make sure everyone is included.</p>
